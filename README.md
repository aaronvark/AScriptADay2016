# AScriptADay2016
I am trying to post a script a day for every day in 2016. 
The goal of this is apart from personal development to get over the fear of sharing terrible code. 
I think, especially for group efforts, it is very important of being able to share code, 
even if it isn't great so everybody can learn from it. 

So be warned, the will be a lot of awful code in here. 
I will focus on getting stuff done in very short amounts of time and not on prettiness.  

Most of the Scripts will be game related, because I am a game developer ;) 
If you have ideas about stuff you would like to see, feel free to send me a mail or contact me on twitter 
and I will try to fit it in. 
In general I will anounce stuff over twitter so if you'd like to get updates (and other comments :D) follow me. 
My twitterhandle is: @dasmalle

Fell free to use and modify the scripts but please keep them open source, 
so that I and other can learn from it too. 

Let's see how it goes, 
Cheers dasmalle

PS: Feel free to comment and point out mistakes and the like, but keep it friendly will ya?
